1. cd to the dashboard-QWIM under "CapstoneQWIM_BlackLitterman" folder.
2. Create environment: python3 -m venv venv
3. Activate environment: source venv/bin/activate
4. Run: shiny run --reload --launch-browser src/dashboard/main_App.py
5. Exit dashboard: ctrl+C
6. Exit virtual environment by enter: deactivate
